Description: Project Athena's notification service - non-Kerberos libraries
 Zephyr is derived from the original Project Athena 'Instant Message' system
 and allows users to send messages to other users or to groups of users.
 Users can view incoming Zephyr messages as windowgrams (transient X
 windows) or as text on a terminal.
 .
 This package provides the libraries without Kerberos support.

Description: Project Athena's notification service - non-Kerberos server
 Zephyr is derived from the original Project Athena 'Instant Message' system
 and allows users to send messages to other users or to groups of users.
 Users can view incoming Zephyr messages as windowgrams (transient X
 windows) or as text on a terminal.
 .
 This package provides the server for the messaging service, which
 maintains a location and subscription database for all the receiving
 clients. All zephyrgrams are sent to the server to be routed to the
 intended recipient. Only one server is required for a group of clients.

 Users can view incoming Zephyr messages as windowgrams (transient X
 windows) or as text on a terminal.
 .
 This package provides the server for the messaging service. Only one
 server is needed for a group of client. The program consumes much memory,
 especially for very large sites.
 .
 The server maintains a location and subscription database for all the
 receiving clients. All zephyrgrams are sent to the server to be routed
 to the intended recipient.
 .
 This version of the server uses Kerberos.
