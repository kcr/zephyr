This is the Project Athena Zephyr notification system version 2.0.
Zephyr allows users to send messages to other users or to groups of
users.  Users can view incoming Zephyr messages as windowgrams
(transient X windows) or as text on a terminal. Zephyr can optionally
make use of the Kerberos version 4 security library or the Hesiod
service name resolution library.

Please note that Zephyr version 2.0 is not compatible with previous
versions of Zephyr, in two important ways.  First, the inter-server
brain dump protocol has changed, so a version 2.0 Zephyr server and an
older Zephyr server will not be able to brain dump to each other.
Second, Zephyr clients built from sources earlier than the January 3,
1995 snapshot will not be able to send authentic notices through
version 2.0 Zephyr servers.

Comments, suggestions, bug reports, or patches should go to
bug-zephyr@mit.edu.

To find out how to configure, build, and install Zephyr, read the file
INSTALL.

To find out how to operate a Zephyr service, read the file OPERATING.

To find out how to use an existing Zephyr service, read the file
USING.

Please read the file NOTES before making any modifications to the
source tree.

LaTeX files for the Zephyr API are located on doc/progman.  These
documents may serve as a useful reference, but they have not been
under recent maintenance, so they might have become somewhat out of
date.
