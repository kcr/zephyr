 * This routine computes the DES key schedule given a key.  The
 * permutations and shifts have been done at compile time, resulting
 * in a direct one-step mapping from the input key to the key
 * schedule.
 *
 * Also checks parity and weak keys.
 *
 * Watch out for the subscripts -- most effectively start at 1 instead
 * of at zero.  Maybe some bugs in that area.
 *
 * DON'T change the data types for arrays and such, or it will either
 * break or run slower.  This was optimized for Uvax2.
 *
 * In case the user wants to cache the computed key schedule, it is
 * passed as an arg.  Also implies that caller has explicit control
 * over zeroing both the key schedule and the key.
 *
 * All registers labeled imply Vax using the Ultrix or 4.2bsd compiler.
 *
