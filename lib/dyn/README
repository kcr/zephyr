libdyn.a -- Release 1.0

A C Dynamic Object is an array that takes care of resizing itself as
elements are added and deleted from it.  It can be of any type for
which sizeof is defined and for which an address of a variable of that
type can be passed to a function.

To build libdyn.a, simply type "make depend all" (if you don't have
the program makedepend, of course, leave out the "depend" part).  If
your system's bcopy() cannot handle overlapping regions, you'll need
to write one that can.  (Left as an excercise for the reader..)

The library should compile and work without modification on a vast
number of systems.  It only uses 5 external functions: malloc,
realloc, free, bcopy, and fprintf (to stderr).  Of these, only bcopy
should need to be changed for other systems (such as MS-DOS) and it
could probably be done with a -D flag to the compiler.

The test/demo program is built by "make all".  This program produces
the library's debugging output (to stderr) as well as some of its own
output (to stdout).

The library has been tested (with test.c) on a VAX VSII, VAXstation
3100, DECstation 3100, and IBM RT all running BSD4.3 (except for the
DECstation, which was running Ultrix V2.1).

An earlier version of this library was posted to alt.sources.  This
version contains one new function (DynInsert) and slightly cleaner
code, but no bugfixes (no bugs were found).
