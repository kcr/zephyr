.SH NAME
zephyr \- Zephyr Notification Service
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Zephyr is a notice transport and delivery system developed at MIT
which runs under 4.3BSD Unix.
.PP
A Notice Transport and Delivery system is a method of getting small
quantities of time sensitive information efficiently from one client
(or server) on a network to another.  The object is to accomplish this
with the highest possible fan-out (i.e., client to server ratio) while
maintaining both network and server performance.  Zephyr is a
multi-cast notice transport and delivery system based upon an
authenticated datagram protocol.  Localized Zephyr servers provide
routing, queueing and dispatching services to clients which
communicate with them via the Zephyr Client Library.  Two special
purpose Zephyr clients, the WindowGram client and the HostManager
client provide user and client host communication support.
.PP
.I Zephyrd(8)
servers run on designated server machines.  These servers maintain a
database of subscriptions and locations for every user using Zephyr.
The servers stay in contact with one another, and provide a reliable
backup system (via duplication) in the event of network failures.
.PP
Each client machine on the network runs a
.I zhm(8)
HostManager client program which is the link between the Zephyr
servers and the users.  User programs send notices to the HostManager,
and the HostManager forwards these notices to the nearest server for
action.  The HostManager is responsible for ensuring that the notices
reach a server, and for finding a new one if its server fails to respond.
.PP
Each user on the network usually runs a WindowGram client program
automatically upon login.
.I Zwgc(1)
displays notices to the user, and handles user
responses.  Only notices to which the user has subscribed will be sent
to the WindowGram client.
.PP
Subscriptions are handled through the
.I zctl(1)
program.  This program allows the user to add or delete subscriptions
from Zephyr, to add the subscriptions to a file, and to perform other
miscellaneous functions.
