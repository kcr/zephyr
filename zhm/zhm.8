.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Zhm
is the link between a client machine and the zephyr server.  All
notices sent from programs on the client are funneled through
.I zhm.
This allows all client programs to be much simpler in function, since
the HostManager is responsible for handling errors, retransmitting
lost notices, and holding all notices until they are acknowledged.
.PP
The
.I -d
option turns on debugging mode, and sends its information to syslog
LOG_DAEMON messages.
.PP
The
.I -n
option causes zhm to not attempt to put itself in the background.
.PP
The
.I -r
option causes
.I zhm
to send a boot notice to the server and exit when the notice is acknowledged.
.PP
The
.I -f
option disables the "flush" operation which allows any client to flush
all subscriptions for the host.
.PP
The
.I -N
option supresses the initial "boot" message that flushes all subscriptions
for the host, which is useful if you're restarting zhm on a host that
people are using.
.PP
The optional
.I server
arguments are used to replace the set of server names supplied by
the
.I hesiod(3)
name server.
