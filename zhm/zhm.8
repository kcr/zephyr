.SH NAME
zhm \- Zephyr HostManager
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/athena/zhm
[
.BI -d
] [
.BI -h
] [
.BI -r
] [
.BI -i
] [
.BI server
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Zhm
is the link between a client machine and the zephyr server.  All
notices sent from programs on the client are funneled through
.I zhm.
This allows all client programs to be much simpler in function, since
the HostManager is responsible for handling errors, retransmitting
lost notices, and holding all notices until they are acknowledged.
.PP
The
.I -d
option turns on debugging mode, and sends its information to syslog
LOG_DAEMON messages.
.PP
The
.I -h
option causes
.I zhm
to send a shutdown message and exit upon delivery of a SIGHUP signal.
The normal action on SIGHUP is to send a flush notice to the zephyr server.
.PP
The
.I -r
option causes
.I zhm
to send a boot notice to the server and then exit.
.PP
The
.I -i
option indicates that
.I zhm
is being started by
.I inetd(8).
When this option is specified,
.I zhm
assumes that file descriptor zero (0) is bound to the UDP datagram port
designated for hostmanager use.  In this mode, SIGHUP is handled as if the
.I -h
option were specified.
.PP
The optional
.I server
argument is used to override the default primary server, supplied by
the
.I hesiod(3)
name server.
