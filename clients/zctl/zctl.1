.SH NAME
zctl \- zephyr control program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B zctl
[
.I options
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Zctl
is a general purpose control program for the
.I Zephyr(1)
Notification Service.  It allows the user to subscribe to specific
notice types, to save the subscriptions in a file (default
$HOME/.zephyr.subs), to change his location information, and to send
control messages to the HostManager,
.I zhm(8),
and the WindowGram client,
.I zwgc(1).
.PP
The commands may be typed on the command line, or may be entered
interactively by just typing
.I zctl
and then typing commands to the prompt.
.br
.B NOTE:
For all commands accepting an optional \fIrecipient\fR argument, the
\fIrecipient\fR defaults to your Kerberos principal.  You may also
subscribe to recipient ``\fI*\fR''.  If you specify a recipient, it is
silently converted to ``\fI*\fR''.
.br
The commands are as follows:
.TP 15
.B add \fIclass instance\fR [ \fIrecipient\fR ]
Subscribe to \fIclass, instance, recipient\fR, and add this triplet to
the subscriptions file.
.TP
.B add_unsubscription \fIclass instance\fR [ \fIrecipient\fR ]
Unsubscribe to \fIclass, instance, recipient\fR, and add this triplet
to the subscriptions file as an un-subscription.
For an explanation of un-subscriptions, see below.
.TP
.B cancel
Cancel all subscriptions.
.TP
.B defaults
Retrieve the default subscription list from the Zephyr server.
.TP
.B delete \fIclass instance\fR [ \fIrecipient\fR ]
Unsubscribe to \fIclass, instance, recipient\fR, and remove this triplet
from the subscriptions file.
.TP
.B delete_unsubscription \fIclass instance\fR [ \fIrecipient\fR ]
Unsubscribe to \fIclass, instance, recipient\fR, and remove this triplet
from the subscriptions file as an un-subscription.
.TP
.B file \fR[ \fIfile\fR ]
Set default subscriptions file to \fIfile\fR.  If \fIfile\fR isn't specified,
show what the current subscriptions file is.
.TP
.B flush_locs
Tell the Zephyr servers to flush all location information associated with
the user.  This should only be used to remove any incorrect data that may have
been left after a system crash.
.TP
.B hide
Hide your location as maintained by the Zephyr server.  This does not
affect the value of the exposure variable (see below, under
.B set).
.TP
.B hm_flush
Tell the HostManager,
.I zhm(8),
to ask the server to flush all state associated with the current host.
.TP
.B list \fR[ \fIfile\fR ]
List contents of current subscriptions file or
.I file.
Any macros in the file (see below) are displayed verbatim and not expanded.
.TP
.B list_requests
List all available commands.  May be abbreviated by '?'.
.TP
.B load \fR[ \fIfile\fR ]
Subscribe to all subscription triplets and unsubscribe to all
un-subscription triplets in current subscriptions file or \fIfile\fR.
.TP
.B new_server
Tell the HostManager,
.I zhm(8),
to find a new Zephyr server.
.TP
.B quit
Exit from \fIzctl.
.TP
.B retrieve
Retrieve all current subscriptions from the Zephyr server.  These include
subscriptions that might have been made by other programs, such as
.I znol(1).
.TP
.B save \fR[ \fIfile\fR ]
Save all current subscriptions (as returned by the Zephyr server)
into current subscriptions file or \fIfile\fR.  The 
file will be replaced.
.TP
.B set \fIvar\fR [ \fIvalue\fR ]
Set the value of Zephyr variable \fIvar\fR to \fIvalue\fR, or null if
no \fIvalue\fR is specified.  The variable \fBexposure\fR has special
significance, and can only be set to the values none, opstaff, realm-visible,
realm-announced, net-visible, and net-announced.  Setting this variable
immediately updates the information in the Zephyr servers (see below for
an explanation of the exposure levels).  In addition,
setting this variable to none automatically performs the equivalent of a 
.B wg_shutdown
command, and setting it to one of the other values automatically
performs the equivalent of a 
.B wg_startup
command.
.br
The variable \fBresolved_addresses\fR determines whether zwgc will,
for an IP address indicating the origin of a message, attempt to look
up the hostname corresponding to that IP address. The value none
indicates that hostnames will never be found, and that the zwgc
fromhost variable will thus always contain an IP address (in
dotted-decimal form). The value all indicates that there will always
be an attempt to look up a hostname. Note that in this case, if you
have any subscriptions with recipient ``\fI*\fR'', these subscriptions
may be revealed to other Zephyr users who operate their own DNS name
servers. Any other value is interpreted as a regular expression;
hostname lookup attempts will occur only if the IP address matches
this regular expression.
.br
Any variable settings you make will be stored in \fI$HOME/.zephyr.vars\fR
.TP
.B show \fIvar\fR [ \fIvar\fR \ ... ]
Show the value of the specified Zephyr variables.  If a variable is not
defined in the user's own variables file, the system variables file
(\fI/etc/athena/zephyr.vars\fR) is searched for a default value.
.TP
.B subscribe \fIclass instance\fR [ \fIrecipient\fR ]
Subscribe to \fIclass, instance, recipient\fR, but don't add this triplet to
the subscriptions file.
.TP
.B unhide
Make your location as maintained by the Zephyr server visible.  This does not
affect the value of the exposure variable.
.TP
.B unload \fR[ \fIfile\fR ]
Unsubscribe to all subscription triplets in current subscriptions file
or \fIfile\fR.  Un-subscriptions in the file are ignored.
.TP
.B unset \fIvar\fR [ \fIvar\fR \ ... ]
Delete the definitions of the specified Zephyr variables.
.TP
.B unsubscribe \fIclass instance\fR [ \fIrecipient\fR ]
Unsubscribe to \fIclass, instance, recipient\fR, but don't remove this triplet
from the subscriptions file.
.TP
.B wg_exit
Tell the WindowGram client,
.I zwgc(1),
to exit.
.TP
.B wg_read
Tell the WindowGram client,
.I zwgc(1),
to reread its description file.
.TP
.B wg_shutdown
Tell the WindowGram client to shutdown; this causes it to ignore all
notices until a wg_startup command is issued.
.TP
.B wg_startup
Tell the WindowGram client to start accepting notices again; useful
after a wg_shutdown command has been issued.
.SH MACROS and SUBSCRIPTION FILES
There are three macros,
.I %host%, %canon%, \fRand\fI %me%.  %host%
is converted to the current hostname, \fI%canon%\fR is converted to the
official hostname as returned by 
.I gethostbyname(3),
and \fI%me%\fR is converted to your Kerberos principal.  These macros can be
used in your \fI$HOME/.zephyr.subs\fR file or as arguments to commands
to specify the
.I class
or 
.I instance
fields.  A sample \fI$HOME/.zephyr.subs\fR file might contain the following:
.PP
.nf
	message,urgent,%me%
	syslog,%host%,*
	mail,pop,%me%
.fi
.PP
.I Zctl
reads the environment variable \fBWGFILE\fR, to find the name of the
file where the windowgram port resides.  If \fBWGFILE\fR is not set,
the file name defaults to /tmp/wg.\fIuid\fR, where \fIuid\fR is the
user's UNIX uid.
.SH UN-SUBSCRIPTIONS
The zephyr server,
.I zephyrd(8),
maintains default subscriptions which are automatically added to all
users' subscriptions at the time of their first subscription during a
login session.  If you wish to automatically remove some of these
default subscriptions, you use 
.B un-subscriptions.
When you 
.B load
a subscription file containing
un-subscriptions, the un-subscriptions are automatically sent to the
server as if you had used the
.B unsubscribe
command.
.SH EXPOSURE LEVELS
The different exposure levels affect the operation of zephyr and its
interaction with the user, as follows:
.TP 10
.I none
This completely disables Zephyr for the user. The user is not
registered with Zephyr.  No user location information is
retained by Zephyr.  No login or logout announcements will be
sent.  No subscriptions will be entered for the user, and no notices
will be displayed by 
.I zwgc(1).
.TP
.I opstaff
The user is registered with Zephyr.  No login or logout
announcements will be sent, and location information will only be
visible to Operations staff.  Default subscriptions and any additional
personal subscriptions will be entered for the user.
.TP
.I realm-visible
The user is registered with Zephyr.  User location information is retained by
Zephyr and made available only to users within the user's
Kerberos realm.  No login or logout announcements will be sent.  This
is the system default.  Default subscriptions and any additional
personal subscriptions will be entered for the user.
.TP
.I realm-announced
The user is registered with Zephyr.  User location information is retained by
Zephyr and made available only to users authenticated within the user's
Kerberos realm.  Login and logout announcements will be sent, but only to
users within the user's Kerberos realm who have explicitly requested
such via subscriptions.  Default subscriptions and any additional
personal subscriptions will be entered for the user.
.TP
.I net-visible
The user is registered with Zephyr.  User location information is
retained by Zephyr and made available to any authenticated user who
requests such. Login and logout announcements will be sent only to users
within the user's Kerberos realm who have explicitly requested such via
subscriptions.  Default subscriptions and any additional personal
subscriptions will be entered for the user.
.TP
.I net-announced
The user is registered with Zephyr. User location information is retained by
Zephyr and made available to any authenticated user who requests such.  Login
and logout announcements will be sent to any user has requested such.
Default subscriptions and any additional personal
subscriptions will be entered for the user.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP 25

Subscribe to personal messages, but don't add this to the
subscriptions file.
.TP
.B zctl save
Save all current subscriptions to the default subscriptions file.
.TP
.B zctl set exposure none
Set your exposure level to `none', effectively turning off Zephyr.
