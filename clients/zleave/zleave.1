.TH ZLEAVE 1 "July 1, 1988" "MIT Project Athena"
.ds ]W MIT Project Athena
.SH NAME
zleave \- notify you via Zephyr when you have to leave 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B zleave
[ [+]
.I hhmm
] [
.I can\fR[\fIcel\fR]
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Zleave
waits until the specified time, then reminds you that you
have to leave, using the \fIZephyr(1)\fR Notification Service.
You are reminded 5 minutes and 1 minute before the actual
time, at the time, and every minute thereafter.
When you log off,
.I zleave
exits just before it would have sent the next message.
.PP
The time of day is in the form hhmm where hh is a time in
hours (on a 12 or 24 hour clock).
All times are converted to a 12 hour clock, and assumed to
be in the next 12 hours.
.PP
If the time is preceded by `+', the alarm will go off in hours and minutes
from the current time.
.PP
If no argument is given,
.I zleave
prompts with "When do you
have to leave?". A reply of newline causes
.I zleave
to exit,
otherwise the reply is assumed to be a time.
This form is suitable for inclusion in a
.I .login
or
.I .profile.
.PP
The
.I cancel
option cancels the currently running \fIzleave\fR.  If another
.I zleave
is running, it is automatically killed when a new time to leave is
set.  The process id is stored in the file /tmp/zleave.\fIuid\fR, where
\fIuid\fR is the user's UNIX uid.
.PP
.I Zleave
automatically subscribes you to Zephyr class "MESSAGE",
instance "LEAVE".  You do not have to add anything to your
default subscriptions file (see \fIzctl(1)\fR).
.PP
If Zephyr is unavailable,
.I zleave 
acts essentially like 
.I leave(1).
.PP
Zleave ignores SIGINT, SIGQUIT, and SIGTERM.
To get rid of it you should either log off or use the
.I cancel
option.
