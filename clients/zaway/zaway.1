.SH NAME
zaway \- tell other people that you aren't around
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B zaway
[
.I file
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Zaway
provides a way for you to automatically send replies when other people
contact you using
.I zwrite(1). Zaway
subscribes itself to class "MESSAGE", instance "*", so that it can
monitor your incoming messages.  It does not affect the operation of any
of client receiving messages.
.I Zaway
uses a message file (which defaults
to $HOME/.away) to describe what reponses should be sent to which
senders.  The general format of this file
is:
.PP
.nf
	>name
	>name
	message
	>name
	message
.fi
.PP
Any number of user names may be specified preceding the message to send
to those senders.  If a user name appears more than once, the message will
be a concatenation of each of the appropriate messages.  There are
two special names: "*" indicates that the following message should be
sent to all senders and "%" indicates that the following message should
only be sent if the user name has not matched yet. 
.PP
If no file is specified,
and no default file can be found, the following message is returned:
.in +5
I'm sorry, but I am currently away from the terminal and am
not able to receive your message.
.in -5
If a user name does not match any of those listed in the file, and no
"*" or "%" field is specified, no return message is sent.
All messages are preceded by the line "Automated reply:".
To avoid loops, messages are not sent in response to messages beginning
with "Automated reply:" or sent by the same Kerberos principal as the
user running 
.I zaway.

.SH SAMPLE FILE
.nf
>eichin
>tony
Hi there guys!  I'm in the other room right now.
I'll be back in 5 minutes or so.
>jruser
Sorry, but I'm gone for the day...
>%
Hello...I'm not sure who you are.  I'll be back soon,
though.
>*
This message comes to you compliments of zaway!
.fi

The final "compliments" message will be included in all messages,
whereas the "I'm not sure" message will only be included in messages that
are not from "eichin", "tony", or "jruser".
