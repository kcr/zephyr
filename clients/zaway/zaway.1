.TH ZAWAY 1 "July 1, 1988" "MIT Project Athena"
.ds ]W MIT Project Athena
.SH NAME
zaway \- tell other people via Zephyr that you aren't around
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B zaway
[
.I OPTIONS
]
[
.I FILE
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I zaway
provides a way for you to automatically send replies when other people
contact you using
.I zwrite(1). zaway
subscribes itself to class "MESSAGE", instance "*", so that it can
monitor your incoming messages.  It does not affect the operation of any
other client receiving messages.
.I zaway
is typically run when you are leaving your terminal or display
temporarily.
.I zaway
usually never exits; when you return to your terminal you should type
the interrupt character (usually ^C) in order to make
.I zaway
exit.
.SS OPTIONS
.TP
.I "\-m STRING"
Use STRING as the body of the auto-reply message.  Any message file
(specified on the command line or the default) is ignored.
.TP
.I "\-w"
Watch the invoking user's location status.  If the user is locatable
anywhere, no auto-replies will be sent.
.TP
.I "\-h"
Displays a short usage message and exits.
.PP
.I zaway
uses a message file (which defaults
to $HOME/.away) to describe what reponses should be sent to which
senders.  The general format of this file
is:
.PP
.nf
	>name
	>name
	message
	>name
	message
.fi
.PP
Any number of user names may be specified preceding the message to send
to those senders.  If a user name appears more than once, the message will
be a concatenation of each of the appropriate messages.  There are
two special names: "*" indicates that the following message should be
sent to all senders and "%" indicates that the following message should
only be sent if the user name has not matched yet. 
.PP
If no file is specified,
and no default file can be found, the following message is returned:
.sp
.in +5
I'm sorry, but I am currently away from the terminal and am
not able to receive your message.
.in -5
.sp
If a user name does not match any of those listed in the file, and no
"*" or "%" field is specified, no return message is sent.  All
messages are preceded by a signature "Automated reply:".  To avoid
loops, messages are not sent in response to messages beginning with an
"Automated reply:" signature or sent by the same Kerberos principal as
the user running
.I zaway.

.SH SAMPLE FILE
.nf
>eichin
>tony
Hi there guys!  I'm in the other room right now.
I'll be back in 5 minutes or so.
>jruser
Sorry, but I'm gone for the day...
>%
Hello...I'm not sure who you are.  I'll be back soon,
though.
>*
This message comes to you compliments of zaway!
.fi

The final "compliments" message will be included in all messages,
whereas the "I'm not sure" message will only be included in messages that
are not from "eichin", "tony", or "jruser".
