.SH SYNOPSIS

] [
.BI -f \ file

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Znol
provides a way for you to be notified when interesting people log in
or out.  It uses the
.I Zephyr(1)
Notification Service, which causes a message to appear on your screen
for every person specified in a namelist (which defaults to
$HOME/.anyone).  Anyone in the namelist who is logged in when
.I znol
is executed is printed to stdout.  The control arguments are as
follows:
.TP 12
.B on|off
Turns notification on or off.
.TP
.B \-f
The namelist file is taken to be
.I file.
If
.I file
does not exist, an error message is printed, and
.I znol
exits.
.TP
.B \-l
Causes
.I znol
to just list the people in the namelist who are currently logged in,
without subscribing to the login messages.  Cannot be used with the
.BI \-q
option.
.TP
.B \-q
Disables printing who is currently logged in when subscribing.  Cannot
be used with the
.BI \-l
option.
