.SH NAME
znol \- notify via Zephyr upon login or logout of interesting people
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B znol
[
.BI on|off
] [
.BI \-f \ file
] [
.BI \-u \ username
] [
.BI \-l
] [
.BI \-q
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Znol
provides a way for you to be notified when "interesting" people log in
or out.  It uses the
.I Zephyr(1)
Notification Service, which causes a message to appear on your screen
for every person specified in a namelist (which defaults to
$HOME/.anyone).  The namelist should have one login name per line.  Any
line starting with `#' is considered a comment and ignored.
Anyone in the namelist who is logged in when
.I znol
is executed is printed to stdout.  The control arguments are as
follows:
.TP 12
.B on|off
Turns notification on or off.
.TP
.B \-f
The namelist file is taken to be
.I file.
If
.I file
is "-", then the standard input is used instead of a file. If
.I file
does not exist, an error message is printed, and
.I znol
exits.
This option may not be used in conjunction with the
.B \-u
option.
.TP
.B \-l
Causes
.I znol
to just list the people in the namelist who are currently logged in,
without subscribing to the login messages.   This option may not be used
in conjunction with the
.BI \-q
option.
.TP
.B \-q
Disables printing who is currently logged in when subscribing.  This
option may not be used in conjunction with the
.BI \-l
option.
.TP
.B \-u
Instead of reading a file to specify the "interesting" users, the next
argument is used as the only "interesting" user.  This option may not be
used in conjunction with the
.B \-f
option.
.SH EXAMPLES

for notices about those users.
