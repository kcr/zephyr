.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Zwrite
sends a message from you to another user through the
.I zephyr(1)
notification service.  The user must have subscribed to messages of
class ``MESSAGE'', instance ``PERSONAL'' and/or ``URGENT'', using the
.I zctl(1)
program.
.PP
.I Zwrite
understands the following options.
.TP 12
.B \-a
Causes
.I zwrite
to send an authenticated message, using
.I kerberos.
.TP
.B \-i
Allows a user to specify a different instance than the default
``PERSONAL'' or ``URGENT'' ones.  When this option is used, the message
is sent to recipient "*".  This allows a message to be sent to a large
group of people (e.g. a development group) just by having the members
group to messages of class "MESSAGE", the specified instance, and recipient
"*".
.TP
.B \-q
Forces
.I zwrite
to suppress information about whether or not the message was sent.
.TP
.B \-u
Sends an urgent message.  This is to allow one to unsubscribe to
instance ``PERSONAL'' messages, but remain able to receive instance
``URGENT'' ones.
.TP
.B \-v
Causes
.I zwrite
to print what type of message it is sending, and whether or not it was
successful.
.TP
.B \-m
.I Zwrite
sends the remaining arguments on the command line as the message.
.PP
If the
.I \-m
option is not specified, the user is prompted for the message to be
sent.  The message may be terminated by typing ^D or ``.'' on a line
by itself.
