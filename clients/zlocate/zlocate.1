.SH NAME
zlocate \- find a user
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B zlocate
[
.BI user \ ...
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Zlocate
uses the
.I Zephyr(1)
Notification Service to find where a user is currently logged in.  If
the user is not logged in, or has set his location information such that
you do not have access to see it,
.I zlocate
prints "Hidden or not logged-in".  Otherwise, each machine that the
user is currently logged into is printed, along with the time of
login and location.  The location is usually the X window system display
name of the user's display, but may be the terminal name if he is not
using X or for some other reason is only using the terminal interface to
.I zwgc(1).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.I zlocate
exits with status zero (0) if at least one user was found, and one (1)
if no users were found.
