; Emacs mode for running zwgc in a sub process of emacs. It pops up a
; window for every new message; if you make bells appear between each
; message, it will be able to seperate them. If you move the mouse
; into the message window and hit `delete' it will delete the current
; message; if there are other messages, it will show them, if not, it
; will make the window go away.
;
; Invoke with M-x zwgc.
; 
; Also included is M-x zsend, which prompts for a user name and a
; message to send to them. If the message is blank, a buffer is popped
; up to edit the message in. If a prefix argument is given, zsend
; prompts for an instance instead. If the user name is blank, the last
; one is reused.
; 
; The following should be added to your .zephyr.desc file if you want
; to take advantage of the zwgc message seperation features:
;	does $mode
;	match tty
;		beep
;	endmatch
;	enddoes
