/*
 * dictionary - a module implementing a generic dictionary.  That is,
 *              any type can be used for the values that keys are bound to.
 *              Keys are always strings.
 *
 * Overview:
 *
 *        A dictionary is a set of bindings which bind values of some
 *    type (this type is the generic parameter of the dictionary) to
 *    strings.  At most one value can be bound to any one string.
 *    The value that a string is bound to can be changed later.
 *    Bindings can also be deleted later.  It is also possible to
 *    enumerate all of the bindings in a dictionary.  Dictionarys
 *    are heap based and must be created & destroyed accordingly.
 *
 *    Note: This module assumes that malloc NEVER returns 0 for reasonable
 *          requests.  It is the users responsibility to either ensure that
 *          this happens or supply a version of malloc with error
 *          handling.
 *
 *    Dictionarys are mutable.
 *
 * Implementation:
 *
 *        A standard chaining hash table is used to implement dictionarys.
 *    Each dictionary has an associated size (# of slots), allowing
 *    different size dictionaries as needed.

 *                 The returned dictionary must be destroyed using
 *                 TYPE_T_dictionary_Destroy.  Size is a time vs space
 *                 parameter.  For this implementation, space used is
 *                 proportional to size and time used is proportional
