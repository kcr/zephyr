# Opcode "ping" is used by sender programs to see if the message would
# really get sent, or if the recipient has logged out.  No useful
# information is normally contained in these messages, so we discard them.
if (upcase($opcode) == "PING") then exit endif

#
# AUTHENTICATION information
#
# $auth can be either Yes, No, or Forged
#
# "Yes" means that the sender field present in the notice was verified by
# Kerberos authentication
#
# "No" means that either the sender did not include any authentication
# information, or the authentication information was not verified by the
# Zephyr Server before the notice was sent to you.
#
# "Forged" means that the Server claims that the sender of the notice
# was verified by Kerberos authentication, but your WindowGram client
# could not verify this.  This stage of verification is done by a cryptographic
# checksum.  The most probable cause of the failure of the checksum
# provided by the Server to match the checksum generated by your
# WindowGram client is that you changed Kerberos tickets, and the Server
# was using an old value to compute the cryptographic checksum.  You can
# update the Server's value by typing 'zctl load' to your prompt.
#
# By default, notices which appear forged are labeled as 'UNAUTHENTIC'
# to avoid confusion as to what 'Forged' really means.
# To change this display, change the last word in the line following
# 'match "forged" to something other than "UNAUTHENTIC".

#  
# MAIL NOTIFICATION
#
# To receive mail notifications, you need to do several things:
# 1) subscribe to MAIL,POP messages.  You do this by typing:
#	zctl add mail pop
# to your prompt.  By doing this, you will get a simple notice every
# time you are logged in and more mail arrives for you at your post office.
#
# 2) If you wish to be notified of the sender, recipient and subject of the
# new mail, remove the pound-signs from the beginning of the 10 lines below
# between 'match "MAIL"' and 'exit', inclusive, and type the command
#	zctl add mail popret
# to your prompt.
#
# Note: The use of the following lines is NOT necessary to receive
# notifications of new mail.  The only effect of uncommenting these
# lines is to display on your screen the sender, recipient and subject
# of the mail (In addition, uncommenting these lines will add extra load
# to the post office servers, making them run slower.).
# If you do not wish this information to be displayed where other users
# might possibly read it, or you wish to avoid loading down the post
# office servers, you need not uncomment these lines.  Just follow step
# 1 above.
