 *        Effects: This routine is called to report a parser or lexer
 *                 error.  Error_message is the error message and line_number
 *                 the line number it occured on.  The reported error message
 *                 is of the form "....<error_message> on line <line #>.\n".
 *                 This routine sets error_occured (local to parser.y) to
 *                 true.  If it was previously false, the error message
 *                 is reported to the user via stderr.

 *        Modifies: *input_file, stderr, all existing nodes
 *        Effects: First this routine destroys all nodes.  Then it parses
 *                 input_file as a zwgc description langauge file.  If
 *                 an error is encountered, an error message is printed
 *                 on stderr and NULL is returned.  If no error is
 *                 encountered, a pointer to the node representation of
 *                 the parsed program is returned, suitable for passing to
 *                 exec.c.  Note that NULL will also be returned for a
 *                 empty file & is a valid program.  Either way, input_file
 *                 is closed before this routine returns.
