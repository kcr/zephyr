/* We have three operations which we need to be able to perform
 * quickly: adding a timer, deleting a timer given a pointer to
 * it, and determining which timer will be the next to go off.  A
 * heap is an ideal data structure for these purposes, so we use
 * one.  The heap is an array of pointers to timers, and each timer
 * knows the position of its pointer in the heap.
 *
 * Okay, what is the heap, exactly?  It's a data structure,
 * represented as an array, with the invariant condition that
 * the timeout of heap[i] is less than or equal to the timeout of
 * heap[i * 2 + 1] and heap[i * 2 + 2] (assuming i * 2 + 1 and
 * i * 2 + 2 are valid * indices).  An obvious consequence of this
 * is that heap[0] has the lowest timer value, so finding the first
 * timer to go off is easy.  We say that an index i has "children"
 * i * 2 + 1 and i * 2 + 1, and the "parent" (i - 1) / 2.
 *
 * To add a timer to the heap, we start by adding it to the end, and
 * then keep swapping it with its parent until it has a parent with
 * a timer value less than its value.  With a little bit of thought,
 * you can see that this preserves the heap property on all indices
 * of the array.
 *
 * To delete a timer at position i from the heap, we discard it and
 * fill in its position with the last timer in the heap.  In order
 * to restore the heap, we have to consider two cases: the timer
 * value at i is less than that of its parent, or the timer value at
 * i is greater than that of one of its children.  In the first case,
 * we propagate the timer at i up the tree, swapping it with its
 * parent, until the heap is restored; in the second case, we
 * propagate the timer down the tree, swapping it with its least
 * child, until the heap is restored. */

/* In order to ensure that the back pointers from timers are consistent
 * with the heap pointers, all heap assignments should be done with the
 * HEAP_ASSIGN() macro, which sets the back pointer and updates the
 * heap at the same time. */
