.SH NAME
zephyrd \- Zephyr server daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.I /usr/etc/zephyrd
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I zephyrd
is the central server for the Zephyr Notification System.
It maintains a location database of all currently logged-in users, and a
subscription database for each user's Zephyr clients.
.PP
.I zephyrd 
communicates with daemons running on other Zephyr server hosts, to
provide a reliable service.
.PP
When a
.B zephyrd
is executed, it requests a list of server machines from Hesiod and
initializes its state from any
\fIzephyrd\fRs executing on the other known servers.  This initialization
is only performed after the \fIzephyrd\fRs have authenticated themselves
to each other via Kerberos.
The server then enters a dispatch loop, servicing requests from clients and
other servers.
.SH ACCESS CONTROL
Certain notice classes are restricted by the Zephyr server.  Each such
class has an access control list enumerating who may transmit or
subscribe to that particular class.
